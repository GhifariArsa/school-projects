# RMIT Projects

Welcome to my collection of projects from my time at RMIT University. Each project showcases a different aspect of my learning journey, from software development and system design to algorithms and hardware integration. Feel free to explore the code, and below each project, I’ve included reflections on what I learned and how I grew as a developer.

### 1. **Procedurally Generated Minecraft Village – Python with MCPI-API**
**Description**: 
A procedurally generated Minecraft village implemented using Python and the MCPI-API. This project includes terrain smoothing and the random generation of houses and rooms, driven by custom algorithms I designed.

**Skills Used**: Python, MCPI-API, Procedural Generation, Algorithm Design

**Reflection**:  
This project was a tough one to start. We were in our first year, so we didn’t have much coding experience under our belts. The task was to design an algorithm that could randomly generate a Minecraft village, complete with randomly generated houses and rooms. As a team, we brainstormed and eventually landed on a solution: we’d develop an algorithm that could pick locations for the houses, terraform the land where the house would sit, and then generate random houses, rooms, and connecting roads.

I took charge of designing the terraforming algorithm. To smooth out the terrain around the village, I used an image processing technique called Gaussian blur, which made the land look more natural for building. Afterward, I teamed up with a friend to design the room generation algorithm, which we implemented using recursion to handle the random layouts.

Through all the debugging, overheating computers running both the Minecraft server and Python code, and an insane amount of waiting, we managed to pull through. It wasn’t easy, but seeing the village come together was incredibly rewarding.

**What I Learned**:
- Procedural content generation
- Algorithm design for terrain and building generation
- Python’s integration capabilities with APIS

### 2. **WebApp built with Java, with Javalin and Thymeleaf**
**Description**: 
This full-stack web app aims to raise awareness about homelessness in Australia through an interactive data dashboard. The dashboard fetches data on various aspects of homelessness, allowing users to explore it visually with filters based on region, demographics, and other relevant criteria.

**Skills Used**: Java, Javalin, Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, Javascrip, SQL

**Reflection**:  
This project, completed during my first year, was my first real exposure to building a full-stack web application with both a functional backend and frontend. Initially, we were asked to create the frontend using simple HTML and hardcoded return statements from the backend. However, since I had previous experience with Thymeleaf during my internship, I decided to take on the challenge and integrate it into the project. It took some time to learn, but once I got the hang of it, everything fell into place and made development much smoother. While designing the backend was fun, it was also tedious at times. On the other hand, I thoroughly enjoyed working on the frontend, as it gave me more creative freedom.

**What I Learned**:
- Full Stack Application Design
- API Development
- Database Design

### 3. **React Movie App**
**Description**:  
This is a full-stack movie application, featuring a catalog of movies, a "coming soon" section, user reviews, account creation, and an admin dashboard. Users can browse through detailed movie listings, stay updated on upcoming releases, and read and write reviews. Administrators have access to manage movie listings and reviews through a dedicated dashboard.

**Skills Used**: React, NodeJS, Bootstrap, ExpressJS, SQL, Postgres, Javascript, HTML, CSS

**Reflection**:  
This project, completed in my second year, was a milestone in my coding journey. With more experience under my belt, my teammate and I were able to finish it in a relatively short time. It was my first exposure to React and Express, and once I got the hang of it, I was completely hooked. Since then, React has become my go-to framework for web applications. Looking back at the web app we built using Java and Thymeleaf, my teammate and I often marvel at how we managed to pull it off! This project really ignited my passion for learning more about JavaScript frameworks and their capabilities.

**What I Learned**:
- Frontend design with React
- API development using Express.js
- Database design and integration with PostgreSQL
- Project management and teamwork
- Expanded knowledge of JavaScript technologies
